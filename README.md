Uses Rasberry pi SMI peripheral to implement USB low speed for communicating with HID devices.

**very much a work in progress**

The intention of this (aside from testing my skills) is to allow the use of keyboards as generic input devices for the Raspberry Pis (104 button macropad for example); And to allow wired human input on the Pi Zero line without occupying the sole USB port, freeing it up for other uses (most likley Gadget Mode or OTG)

Based heavily upon the work of Jeremy P Bentham
